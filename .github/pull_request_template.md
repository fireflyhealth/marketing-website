for frontend PRs, you can use this table to put screengrabs & figma designs side-by-side. This can be a chore but is great for catching things you might have missed!

Github will insert line breaks when you paste in an image, so you'll need to do a bit of reformatting to get it to look like:

| <img width="350" ...> | <img width="350" ...> |

Tip: Set the "width" attribute manually to force column widths to match
